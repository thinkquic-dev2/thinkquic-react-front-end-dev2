 - rowSelection="multiple"
 - onGridReady //from useAgTable hook
 - onColumnVisible //from useAgTable hook 

Bug
 - uploading the same file through FileUploader does not trigger the TableContainer
 - to replicate, upload a file, discard the table, upload the same file.

Background
 - FileUploader has an onChange handler. Uploading the same file multiple times does not 
   trigger onChange.
 - the ref to the fileUploader file input is created in appContext

Fix
 - delete the input ref file once processed by setRawDataFile



Problem
 - when to display or not display upload button in table container.
Expected Behavior
 - when a user uploads a file, the file gets displayed as a table.
 - in the table interface, there should be a button to upload to s3
 - when the user clicks on the button, there should be a message that says 
   the file is uploaded.
 - the button should disappear

Uploading file still not working. because the inputref is being cleared everything a file is selected(before uploading)\

Identify These two type:
	{"item":"string","quantityOnHand":"numeric","quantitySold":"numeric"}
	{"dataOne":{"item":"string","quantityOnHand":"numeric","quantitySold":"numeric"},"dataTwo":{"item":"string","quantityOnHand":"numeric","quantitySold":"numeric"}}
